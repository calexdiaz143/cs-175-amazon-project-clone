        These are great!  We had a lot of trouble getting bibs on our infant, she'd be so squirmy especially once she knew it was bottle time, so the snap on the side of her neck is so much easier than having to get behind her back.  These are thick and absorbent, they're also soft, and they're large enough we can use it now that we use solid foods and she makes an enormous mess.
